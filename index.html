               <p>
                This dashboard provides an overview of the temperature, humidity, light value, and soil moisture conditions for your plant box over the past week. You can use this information to make sure your plant is getting the ideal environment it needs to thrive. To learn more about your plant's ideal growing conditions, please consult the plant care guide for your specific species. We hope you enjoy using your plant dashboard! If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact us.

               <h4>Dashboard Page</h4>
               <p>This dashboard displays temperature, humidity, light value, soil moisture, project status, and the number of temperature and humidity interruptions. The first graph displays the daily averages for temperature, humidity, light value, and soil moisture. The second graph depicts the daily average number of temperature and humidity interruptions. In other words, the dashboard provides an overview of your plant box's environmental conditions and project status, as well as any potential problems that may arise.</p>

                                            This clever setup employs high-tech equipment to create and maintain the best environment in the plant box. It accomplishes this through the use of sensors, actionable tools, and intelligent control systems. These systems collaborate to control critical variables such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and tank volume. All of this ensures that the hardware functions properly to create an ideal environment for the plants. This keeps the plants inside the plant box healthy, strong, and growing well.<br>
                                            <strong>Enter Project Name</strong> – Users can give the project a name or a special mark in this section. This makes distinguishing one project from others easier.<br>
                                            <strong>Select a Plant Box</strong> – This is a drop-down menu, similar to a list, from which users can select a plant box from the list they created in the "Plantbox Setup" section. It allows users to connect a specific plant box to the project.<br>
                                            <strong>Select Configured Setup for the Project</strong> – This is another drop-down menu, similar to a list, from which users can select the best environment setup for their project. Users can choose from the configurations they created in the "Ideal Environment Setup" section.<br>

To use the charts, first select a project from the drop-down menu. Then, select the interval type you want to view. The default interval is "Hourly", but you can also view the progress by day, week, or month. Overall, the project charts are a valuable tool for evaluators. They can be used to track the progress of projects, identify potential problems, and take steps to get projects back on track. </p>
